              Over the years, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work with a variety of clients and teams, helping to build scalable and efficient web solutions. My journey as a web developer began with an internship at Company X, where I gained hands-on experience in front-end development. Since then, I have worked on several full-stack web projects and have expanded my expertise in modern web frameworks and tools.

              I have collaborated with cross-functional teams, managed projects, and helped optimize the user experience of both small and large-scale applications. I am always eager to learn new skills and improve my expertise as a developer.

              Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring photography, traveling to new places, and playing strategy games. I believe in a balanced life where creativity meets logic, and I often find inspiration from my hobbies that help me think outside the box when it comes to problem-solving in web development.
